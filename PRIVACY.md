# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 15, 2025

Cuppy Development ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Cuppy Discord Bot (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information related to users of the Service.

---

## Information We Collect

The Service itself does **not collect or store any personal information** from users. Any personal data (such as messages, usernames, or other account information) is handled by **Discord**. We do not access, store, or share this information outside of what is necessary for the Service to function.

---

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use or process any user data beyond what is necessary for the bot to operate within Discord servers. All data remains within Discord and under your control.

---

## Third-Party Services

The Service does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. All functionality occurs within Discord.

---

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not share, sell, or disclose** any user data to third parties. Any information generated by the bot stays within our company systems and is used only for maintaining and improving the Service.

---

## Data Security

Although we do not collect or store personal information, we implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect any operational data related to the Service.

---

## User Control and Rights

The Service is linked to your Discord account. If you wish to stop using the Service or revoke access, you can simply remove the bot or disconnect it from your Discord account. Discord provides tools for managing and deleting your own data.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
